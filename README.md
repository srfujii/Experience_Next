  ## Description

  This full stack web application is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. It follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. The MYSQL database itself is made up of three tables, Author, BlogPost, and Comment, each of which are modeled using sequelize and interacted with using our Express api routes. 

  Users can register as new authors or login to an existing author account. They can create new blog posts, edit and delete blog posts, and add new comments to any previously created blog post.
